Mongodb
=======

## Features

## Immediate Roadmap

  * Bang and non-bang `Mongo` functions
  * Documentation
  * Move low-level API to `Connection` and have `Mongo` be the next-gen driver API
    - Split database and collection actions?
  * Move BSON encoding to client process
    - Make sure requests don't go over the 16mb limit
  * Replica sets
    - Block in client (and timeout) when waiting for new primary selection
  * New 2.6 write queries and bulk writes
  * Cursors
  * Reconnect backoffs with https://github.com/ferd/backoff
  * Lazy connect

## Tentative Roadmap

  * SSL
  * Use meta-driver test suite
  * Smarter pooling
    - A single connection can serve multiple requests concurrently so traditional pooling (like poolboy) a where single process takes exclusive access of a connection may not fit. Furthermore it is not ideal that long running cursors reserves a connection from the pool for the cursor's full duration. Pooling libraries such as sbroker allows a connection to serve multiple requests, ideally it would be combined with a dispatcher that selects an appropriate connection based on its internal queue.
  * Server selection / Read preference

## Usage

### Pool

  defmodule MongoPool do
    use Mongo.Pool, name: __MODULE__, adapter: Mongo.Pool.Poolboy
  end

  # Starts a process on the module name MongoPool
  {:ok, _} = MongoPool.start_link(database: "test")

  # Gets an enumerable cursor for the results
  cursor = Mongo.find(MongoPool, "test-collection", %{}) |> Enum.to_list

  Enum.to_list cursor
    |> IO.inspect

### Connection
  # Starts a process on the module name MongoPool
  {:ok, mongo_connection} = Mongo.Connection.start_link(database: "test")

  # Gets an enumerable cursor for the results
  cursor = Mongo.Connection.find(mongo_connection, "test-collection", %{}) |> Enum.to_list
